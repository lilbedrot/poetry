                    Specks of stardust glitter around us<br>
                    And ignite as our lips meet<br>
                    Falling in low gravity<br> 
                    Smoldering at our feet<br>
                    We orbit eachother<br>
                    Endless and complete<br>
                    Time dissolves into nothingness<br>
                    Our hearts weightless and sweet

                    In shallow people-<br>

                    A quietly glowing ball of light can settle and be<br>
                    While softly burning in the eloquent fashion of soft grey bark-<br>
                    The cool touch of taupe green leaves<br>
                    Love smoothly from the tones of a sultry sunset of dusked red on their undersides.<br>
                    Leaves hum loudly on the branches that move along the swell of the tides;<br>
                    As if a pulse could be seen and unheard in the most literal mind,<br>
                    But in the most unliteral of senses it fills the air-<br>
                    Everything becomes aware of the very grids life is assembled upon,<br>
                    No one thing can feel even a small and meer part of itself<br>
                    And not feel its opposite pulling in a different direction

                    With or without you, I ignite.<br>
                    In spaces you don't speak their hides sweet surreal redolence-<br>
                    A hunt to kiss enigma;<br>
                    An intense melodious rush.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am your wounded auxiliary function<br>
                    Underneath you my lacerations weep-<br>
                    Mellifluous, through your fingers,<br>
                    Pooling liquid gold at your front door.

                    Loneliness<br>
                    Is a kind of soft bleed,<br>
                    Of wounds with depths that reach a rudimentary core;<br>
                    A universally congenital ache,<br>
                    To which we are born.

                    Pre-emptive, egocentric bombs you placed in my hands,<br>
                    Thin-skinned black cherries settling and unsettling in a daze of invisible hues,<br>
                    With just enough room to sigh<br>
                    <br>
                    At nine, I sit and wait for you with handfuls of cherries resting on my thighs,<br>
                    And a thin veil of sweat collects in the vallies of my palm creases-<br>
                    The sweaty, sticky mess resonates with pangs of follishness.
